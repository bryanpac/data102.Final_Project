# DATA102 Final Project: Modeling CO‚ÇÇ Emissions Across eGRID Subregions

This repository contains the final project for the UC Berkeley DATA102 course. The project investigates the drivers of CO‚ÇÇ emissions across U.S. electricity subregions using EPA eGRID data.

## üîç Project Overview

We used two complementary approaches:

- **Causal Inference (Synthetic Control Method)** ‚Äì Used to evaluate the impact of potential energy policy interventions over time.
- **Predictive Modeling (GLMs)** ‚Äì Applied both parametric (PCR) and non-parametric (Random Forest) models to predict CO‚ÇÇ emissions and identify key drivers.

## üìà Modeling Summary

### Nonparametric Model (Random Forest)
- Used for high-dimensional prediction without requiring feature selection
- Evaluated using MSE, MAE, and out-of-bag \( R^2 \)
- Identified top predictors using impurity-based feature importances

### Parametric Model (Principal Component Regression)
- Applied PCA to reduce dimensionality and eliminate multicollinearity
- Selected top PCs covering ~92% variance
- Refit the OLS model using only statistically significant PCs (PC1, PC3, PC5)
- Back-projected coefficients to interpret feature contributions

### Causal Model (Synthetic Control)
- Constructed synthetic control units to estimate counterfactual CO‚ÇÇ emissions
- Focused on identifying policy impact using pre/post trends
